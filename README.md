## Why this project?
I have always wished to create a game since I was a child. In fact, the desire to create my own game was the original reason I first got into programming at the age of 10 years old.

Although I have since realised how difficult it is to create games, I still find that creating simple games is an excellent way to swiftly learn, develop, and solidify my knowledge in new programming languages. 

That's why I chose to create this game. It's a combination of a childhood dream and my desire to learn TypeScript and Golang in my new quest to become a better web developer. 
I've had a blast creating this game, and hopefully it can eventually provide joy to others as well.
